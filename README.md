# Multi-Threaded-Proxy-server-College-Project

Developed a Multi Threaded Proxy server using Python 3. The proxy receives an HTTP request for an object from a browser, it generates a new HTTP request for the same object and sends it to the origin server. When the proxy receives the corresponding HTTP response with the object from the origin server, it creates a new HTTP response, including the object, and sends it to the client. The proxy will be multi-threaded so that it will be able to handle multiple requests at the same time.
